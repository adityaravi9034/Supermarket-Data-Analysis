# Supermarket Data Analysis 

This repository contains the code and report for the project on predicting gross income based on supermarket sales data. The project aims to analyze historical sales data from three different supermarkets and derive meaningful insights to facilitate decision-making for the supermarkets.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the provided sales dataset and predict the gross income for the three different supermarkets. By answering key questions and extracting valuable insights from the data, this project aims to improve sales performance, identify areas for improvement, and enable evidence-based decision-making.
